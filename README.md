### Doug's Breadboard TTL Computer

This site describes the breadboard computer I'm building. It was inspired by Ben Eater's awesome series of videos and schematics on his web site, https://eater.net/8bit.

I was also inspired by the Gigatron TTL computer which is a bit more professional and who have been gracious enough to publish their schematics, https://gigatron.io/.

Mine will be in between, using 74HCT chips wherever possible to achieve lower power consumption than Ben's. It'll be a full 8 bit address bus with allocation of the memory map to ROM, RAM, and device registers. I'll be adding Ben's VGA video "card" and game controllers so we can make games with this, with first thoughts of Breakout and Pong.

### Step 0 - One bit

A rather humourous tease of lots more to come, the one bit dasPuter :)
